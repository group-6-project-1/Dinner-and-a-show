Tim Hackel-
Built framework for the basic HTML to build containers. Used the zomato API to pull resturants by seraching for cities. To search by city I had to create a loop of cityID's to correlate with the correct search. Bulma css was not working as a grid for my work, I moved to materialize and I was able to get what I needed. Learned CONST & Class to help compelte the project with help from my tutor Phil.
